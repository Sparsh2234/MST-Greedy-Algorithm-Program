# MST-Greedy-Algorithm-Program
Implemented MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) for a weighted, undirected graph using Primâ€™s algorithm. The program uses an 'adjacency list' and 'edge matrix' to support various commands and manipulations. These include: calculating MST value, finding the degree of a vertex, inserting/deleting edges, etc. The program uses a minimum heap data structure to order edges based on lowest weight.
